So I can get passengers to a destination 
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport
# I need:

#   - A Plane class ✅
#   - A land method for the Plane class with argument ✅
#   - A way for Airport to store instances of Plane when .land is called (insert plane instance into array inside airport instance) ✅
#   - An error to be raised if a landed plane given the method to land again ✅

So I can get passengers on the way to their destination 
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport
# I need:
#   - A takeoff method for Plane that removes it from the Airport planes array ✅ (try and find a way to do this without (airport) argument in tskeoff method, but is fine for now)
#   - A string to confirm the plane is no longer in the aiport?

# To ensure safety 
# I want to prevent landing when the airport is full 

# As the system designer
# So that the software can be used for many different airports
# I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
